More info: [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

Build tool/config choices - To change them:

   `eject` at any time. Removes the project's single build dependency.
   It copies all config files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project.

   You will have full control over them. 
   All commands, except `eject`, will still work, but will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. 
   At this point you're on your own.

   You don't have to ever use `eject`. 
   The curated feature set is suitable for small/middle deployments. 
   No obligation to use this feature. 
   This tool is useful because you can customize it when ready.
